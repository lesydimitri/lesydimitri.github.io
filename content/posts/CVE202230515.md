During a recent penetration test, I stumbled upon an instance of the ZKTeco BioTime web application. This application was linked to a time punch clock taking pictures of employees. The management can then analyse these pictures through the web application or an app.

Through some directory fuzzing, I discovered the world-readable directories `/files/photo` and `/files/biophoto`. These directories contained the aforementioned pictures, which were viewable without authenticating to the web app. Since the filename structure used in the web application was incremental, brute-forcing all images present was trivial.
